# ts7200

Hardware constants and basic abstractions for the TS-7200 Single Board Computer.

Includes a basic `bwprintf!` macro to busy-wait send data over a UART.

_Note:_ This crate provides roughly the same functionality as the example files
from CS 452 (`bwio.c/h` + `ts7200.h`), albeit with a few more defined constants.
